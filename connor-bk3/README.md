# Connor

My own (tiny) programming language!

For now, all code must be written in ```input.con```.
I have made this choice to simplify my code (for now).

The file already contains an example.
You might notice that it doesn't contain a main function.
This is because the language is library-only, it's meant to be used in assembly.
In the future, it'll output assembly in Intel syntax.

The language grammar can be found in ```grammar```.
It doesn't follow any standard, I just mixed some that I found online.
I think it's pretty readable, so I'll probably never change it.

PS:
This compiler has been written in such a way that it only compiles the example.
I'll try to fix this, but just know that anything besides the example probably won't compile ;)

PPS:
This repo has been abandoned, it was supposed to be a proof of concept.
The actual compiler is located at [ConnorAsm](https://github.com/not-msb/connor-asm);
