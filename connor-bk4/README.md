My own (tiny) programming language!

For now, all code must be written in ```input.nor```.
I have made this choice to simplify my code (for now).

The file already contains an example.
You might notice that it doesn't contain a main function.
This is because the language is library-only, it's meant to be used in assembly.
In the future, it'll output assembly in Intel syntax.

The language grammar can be found in ```grammar```.
It doesn't follow any standard, I just mixed some that I found online.
I think it's pretty readable, so I'll probably never change it.
